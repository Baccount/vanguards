TODO items that should maybe go into the bug tracker

* Check each vanguard layer against tor's path restrictions - no one layer
  should all be same /16, family, etc. If it does, re-pick node until
  it doesn't. There should be a limit on this before we warn and re-pick the
  whole layer.
* Try to check that other hops in the path match expected consensus weight
  distribution after we have built something like K*len(consensus) circs,
  for K=0.5-10, screaming louder about anomalies as K increases.
* Prototype #23980 by killing circuits after a time period, consensus change,
  and/or total bytes from CIRC_BW events (as options). Separate read+write
  options for total bytes.
* Version the pickled state file
* Make a conf file
* Fix logging system
* Provide ExcludeNodes compatibility (ie GETCONF and don't pick nodes in it)
* Provide an IncludeNodes feature
