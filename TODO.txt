TODO items that should maybe go into the bug tracker

0. Make a README
1. Track previously valid circuits (or perhaps simpler: previous node choices)
   so we don't get confused when settings change.
2. Provide ExcludeNodes compatibility (ie GETCONF and don't pick nodes in it)
3. Provide an IncludeNodes feature
4. Make a conf file
5. Make setup.py, pip requirements, and virtualenv setup scripts
