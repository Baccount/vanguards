TODO items that should maybe go into the bug tracker

* Don't do CIRC_BW checks unless we're 0.3.4+
* Options to disable bandguards
* Unit tests, esp for bandguards and path checks
* Make a conf file
* Fix logging system (esp rate limits)
* Provide ExcludeNodes compatibility (ie GETCONF and don't pick nodes in it)
* Provide an IncludeNodes feature
* Version the pickled state file
* Make debian packages
* Write blog post
* Investigate sharing vanguard state between multiple instances, for
  better use with onionshare.
* Check each vanguard layer against tor's path restrictions - no one layer
  should all be same /16, family, etc. If it does, re-pick node until
  it doesn't. There should be a limit on this before we warn and re-pick the
  whole layer.
